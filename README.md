Overview

The Proof-of-Concept system is built using flask framework with angular2, which provides a decentralized and immutable ledger for recording transactions. The system allows participants to perform transactions and store them securely on the blockchain.
Features

    User registration and authentication
    Secure and transparent transactions
    Immutable transaction history on the blockchain

System Architecture

The system consists of the following components:

    [Frontend]: The user interface for interacting with the system.
    [Backend]: The backend server that handles user authentication, transaction processing, and interacts with the blockchain network.

For a detailed architecture diagram and component interaction, refer to architecture.md.
Prerequisites

Before running the PoC system, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

    Ubuntu
    Mongodb
    Angular
